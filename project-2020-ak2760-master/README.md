## Candidate Number: 35661


## Project title:

Clustering people based on the five fundamental personality traits using k means ++.

## Summary:

I am really interested in this topic, i want to see if people can be seperated into various types based on their answers to these questions.
The methodologies i plan to use is the K means ++ algorithm on the google cloud platform.
The dataset contains 50 items, and technical information (over 100 variables) and answers from 1,015,342 people. The main issue is that the size of this dataset is only around 425MB. I can still use most of the distributed computing tools we have learned for this, I could duplicate values/ generate more values in order to compare the efficiency gain by using distributed computing.
This relates to scalable machine learning.

## Notes

* [MV 30 March 2020] Approved. You need to make sure to cover distributed computing concepts for big data taught in the course in a substantial manner. Just applying an already implemented distributed k-means algorithm to a dataset does not sound very challenging. You may want to focus on the fundamental algorithmic concepts that underlie the k-means++ algorithm, explain them well and how they are implemented in Spark, and discuss, possibly implement, and compare with some alternative distributed algorithms for k-means that you may find in literature.
