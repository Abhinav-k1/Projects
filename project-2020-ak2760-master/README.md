# ST446 Course Project

## Project title:

Clustering people based on the five fundamental personality traits using k means ++.

## Summary:

I am really interested in this topic, i want to see if people can be seperated into various types based on their answers to these questions.
The methodologies i plan to use is the K means ++ algorithm on the google cloud platform.
The dataset contains 50 items, and technical information (over 100 variables) and answers from 1,015,342 people. The main issue is that the size of this dataset is only around 425MB. I can still use most of the distributed computing tools we have learned for this, I could duplicate values/ generate more values in order to compare the efficiency gain by using distributed computing.
This relates to scalable machine learning.
